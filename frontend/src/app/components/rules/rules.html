                <p i18n="@@RULES.HISTORY_TEXT_2">The first book on the game was published in 1756 by William Payne, titled 'An Introduction to the Game of Draughts'.</p>
                <p i18n="@@RULES.HISTORY_TEXT_3">The game's popularity spread throughout the British Empire and became particularly established in the United States, where it is commonly known as 'Checkers'.</p>
                <p i18n="@@RULES.HISTORY_TEXT_4">In 1847, the first world championship of checkers was held, establishing the game as a serious competitive pursuit.</p>

                <p i18n="@@RULES.MOVEMENT_TEXT_2">Capture occurs by jumping over an opponent's piece to an empty square directly beyond. The jumped piece is removed from the board.</p>
                <p i18n="@@RULES.MOVEMENT_TEXT_3">If after a capture it is possible to make further captures, the player must continue the sequence with the same piece until no further captures are possible (multiple jumps).</p>

                <p i18n="@@RULES.KINGS_TEXT_2">A king can move diagonally both forward and backward, but still moves only one square at a time except when capturing.</p>
                <p i18n="@@RULES.KINGS_TEXT_3">Kings capture in the same way as regular pieces, but can do so in all four diagonal directions. Like regular pieces, kings must make all available captures. Kings can be captured by regular pieces following the same capture rules.</p>
